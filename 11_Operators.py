#1-)Comparison Operators
"""
*Operator    *Description	
1-)   ==	 If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.
2-)   !=	 If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
3-)   <>	 If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
4-)   >	     If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
5-)   <	     If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
6-)   >=	 If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
7-)   <=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	

*Example
a=10,b=20 
1-)    (a == b) is not true.
2-)    (a != b) is true.
3-)    (a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.
4-)    (a > b) is not true.
5-)    (a < b) is true.
6-)    (a >= b) is not true.
7-)    (a <= b) is true.

*Operator                   *Description	
1-)and Logical AND          If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.	
2-)or Logical OR            If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true.	
3-)not Logical NOT	        Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.	

*Example
1-)    (a and b) is true.
2-)    (a or b) is true.
3-)    Not(a and b) is false.

#3-)Assignment Operators
"""
*Operator                     *Description	
1-)  += Add AND	              It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand	
2-)  -= Subtract AND          It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand	
3-)  *= Multiply AND	      It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand	
4-)  /= Divide AND	          It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand	
5-)  %= Modulus AND	          It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand	
6-)  **= Exponent AND	      Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand	
7-)  //= Floor Division	      It performs floor division on operators and assign value to the left operand	

*Example
1-) c += a is equivalent to c = c + a
2-) c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a
3-) c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a
4-) c /= a is equivalent to c = c / ac /= a is equivalent to c = c / a
5-) c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a
6-) c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a
7-) c //= a is equivalent to c = c // a
